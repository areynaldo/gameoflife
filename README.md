# gameoflife
Conoway's game of life implementation in pygame.

I just wanted to have some kind of first-contact with Pygame to check if it could fit my needs as a prototyping tool. I also added some extra features to the basic "Game of Life" implementation:

* Press ``SPACE`` to start and pause the simulation.
* Press ``LEFT`` to zoom step one generation.
* Press ``UP`` to zoom out / to add cells to the simulation.
* Press ``DOWN`` to zoom in / to remove cells to the simulation.
